# aRNAlysis

This repository offers a series of Python scripts designed to analyze the three-dimensional structure of multiple single strain RNA molecules.

------ **aRNAlysis is currently under development** ------

## Features
- **Base Pair Detection:** The included scripts allow for the identification of single chain RNAs intra-bp, returning the type of interaction using Biotite packages.
  - *Glycosidic bond:* Cis - Trans.
  - *Edge type:* Watson-Crick - Hoogsteen - Sugar - Wooble GU.
  
- **Hydrogen Bond Identification:** In addition to base pairs, the user is allowed to compute not only base pair H-bonds but all H-bonds in a RNA structure for a more exhaustive analysis.

- **RNA Superimposition:** Given a multiple set of RNAs, aRNAlysis can superpose the structures and compute RMSD and TM-score using US-align packages using two methods.
  - *1 vs 1:* Every structure is superimposed with the rest of files in order to generate a matrix of RMSDs and TM-scores
  - *All vs All:* Given a multiple set of structures, a single superposition is given for all RNAs with a unique average RMSD.

- **Analysis and Clustering:** Using the information calculated in the RNA Superimposition, aRNAlysis provides two possible classifications.
  - *Heatmaps*
  - *Clustering*
